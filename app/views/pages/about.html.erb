  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <pre>
    <strong>Where to start?</strong>
    Hello! So glad to hear you’ve decided to test your GRBAS skills! There are some fun
    options for learning in our application, to do so, please select the Learn
    tab on the top bar! Once you’ve started practicing and you’d like to check review your previous
    practice, check out the user tab to find your quiz/test histories and some personal stats!

    <strong>What are groups?</strong>
    If you’re a Professor account and would like to keep track of how your students are performing,
    you can make a group to check in on all the students apart of the groups you’ve created.
    Once you’ve created the group, simply have your students join the group through their own
    accounts using the join code provided (you’ll find this by locating your current groups page)!

    For Students, groups are mostly for tracking a group’s progress for a Professor.
    To join a group your Professor assigns to you, find the join groups tab (underneath the
    Groups tab along the top bar) and select join group. Enter in the join code
    given to you by your Professor.

  <h2>The GRBAS Scale</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>G</strong> - Grade of Hoarseness - relating to overall level of disorder</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong> - Roughness - irregularity in vocal vibrations, specific listening</li>
    <li><strong>B</strong> - Breathiness - air leakage thru vocal folds, tend to sound like white noise</li>
    <li><strong>A</strong> - Asthenia - weakness or lack of power</li>
    <li><strong>S</strong> - Strain - throat constriction / tone can have high pitch features</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>About</h3>
  <div class="box">
    <pre>
    GRBAS is a perceptual scale that can be used to distinguish some voice
    characteristics. It is mainly used to train the ear to distinguish the
    severity of certain characteristics within the voice ie how much
    strain or weakness is present in the voice. The numerical scale is
    set from 0 to 3. A 0 should represent a normal voice (lack of disorder),
    a 1 is mildly disordered, 2 is moderately disordered, and a 3 is severely disordered.
    This scale is not a complete evaluation or assessment of a patient's condition
    and is only intended for a more objective approach to listening for certain voices.
