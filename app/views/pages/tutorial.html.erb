  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>Hello! So glad to hear youâ€™ve decided to test your GRBAS skills! We are excited to see you get started with learning about GRBAS!</p>

  <p>First and foremost, welcome! Now, what is Teaching Hearing Easy? </p>

  <p>Teaching Hearing Easy lets users start refining their hearing skills
    using a perceptual scale called GRBAS. Users will listen to a sound
    and scale the sound to determine if there's any disorder in the voice.
    This will be scaled on a 0-3 scale for each letter in the GRBAS acronym (0 being a normal voice, 3 being severely disordered).
  </p>

  <h2>The GRBAS Scale</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>G</strong> - Grade of Hoarseness - relating to overall level of disorder</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong> - Roughness - irregularity in vocal vibrations, specific listening</li>
    <li><strong>B</strong> - Breathiness - air leakage thru vocal folds, tend to sound like white noise</li>
    <li><strong>A</strong> - Asthenia - weakness or lack of power</li>
    <li><strong>S</strong> - Strain - throat constriction / tone can have high pitch features</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thus, if you hear what you believe is a normal voice, you'd scale the sound
    at a G0. Teaching Hearing Easy uses different approaches of practice
    geared towards users improving their own internal perceptual scale.
